			<!-- About -->
			<section>
				<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
				
				<p>After graduating college in December of 2019, I began my search for a position to launch
				my career in software development beginning in 2020.  However, early in the process the COVID-19 global pandemic struck, making it even more
				challenging to job hunt.  That was when I discovered Thinkful!</p>
				
				<p>as a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I've furthered my journey to becoming
				a software developer and couldn't be happier!</p>
				
				<p>My passion for software development stems from my interest in the medium of electronic entertainment, and the amazing software that is produced.  Both the artistry combined with 
				cutting edge technologies solidified my desire to create software.</p>
					
				
				<p>If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for a partner for a hakathon)
				please reach out! I am so excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
